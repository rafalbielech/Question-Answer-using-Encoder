                <p> The transformer family of models have been a huge hit in the NLP domain for many reasons. These
                    state-of-the-art variations of the transformer models have proven to be very successful for question
                    answering, inference, sentiment analysis and more. While initially exploring this area, I was amazed
                    by the performance and simplicity of use of the Universal Encoder for a recommendation system that I
                    was building. Please see Google's colab notebook <a
                        href="https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4" target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One particular application of this model that I have not see was using the universal encoder against
                    a dataset of questions and answers to find similiar questions that can be used to provide answers
                    with context. Hence, this is something I explored and shared my code in a <a

                        Dataset</a>
                    is a great resource for a dataset across >400 topic areas with questions, answers, and context
                    already
                    prepared. This dataset is utilized in this project. In the notebook in my <a
                        href="https://github.com/rafalbielech/Question-Answer-using-Encoder" target="_blank">repository
                        on
                        Github</a> only looks at first 15 topic areas, which is roughly over 2000 questions and answers.
                    Then, all of these questions are then fed through the universal sentence encoder model to produce a
                    vector representation of size (1 x 512). The vector representation enables complex text to be
                    converted
                    to a numeric representation that can be later used to cosine similarity, classification, clustering,
                    and
                    more...</p>

                <p>
                    Referencing the example in the original Google colab notebook, if two sentences are talking about
                    the sun shining outside, then these two sentences will be much closer to each other in the vector
                    space than a sentence talking about a rainy day and a sentence talking about a sunny day.

                    From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, Cosine
                    similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an
                    inner product space. It is defined to equal the cosine of the angle between them, which is also the
                    same as the inner product of the same vectors normalized to both have length 1. The cosine of 0° is
                    1, and it is less than 1 for any angle in the interval (0, π] radians. It is thus a judgment of
                    orientation and not magnitude: two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1,
                    two vectors oriented at 90° relative to each other have a similarity of 0, and two vectors
                    diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1, independent of their magnitude.
                </p>
                <p>Thus, the higher the similarity, the higher alikeness between two vectors.</p>

                    Finding the closest 10 results to a question from a list of 2685 questions took 5.3 ms on average.
                    This performance can be further optimized using specific vector database instead of in-memory
                    mechanism. Overall, I think the performance was very impressive. Moreover, forward-feed through the
                    network, despite not being timed, was also very fast.
